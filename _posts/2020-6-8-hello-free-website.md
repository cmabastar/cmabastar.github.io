How hard is setting up a website nowadays?  This website uses Cloudflare, Github.io & Netlify (all on free plans).

  - Cloudflare for DNS
  - Cloudflare pointing to netlify : [https://cmabastar.netlify.app](https://cmabastar.netlify.app)
  - Github pages : [https://cmabastar.github.io/](https://cmabastar.github.io/)
  - Personal domain: [https://cmabastar.dev](https://cmabastar.dev)

All of these links can easily be updated in my github repository with jekyll
as an awesome tool for static builder.

And of course the only thing that is paid is the domain name.
