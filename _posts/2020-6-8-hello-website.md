How hard is setting up a website nowadays?  This website uses Cloudflare, Github.io & Netlify.

  - Cloudflare for DNS
  - Cloudflare pointing to Netlify : [https://cmabastar.netlify.app](https://cmabastar.netlify.app)
  - Github pages : [https://cmabastar.github.io/](https://cmabastar.github.io/)
  - Personal domain: [https://cmabastar.dev](https://cmabastar.dev)

All of these links can be easily be updated in my github repository with jekyll
as an awesome tool for static builder.
