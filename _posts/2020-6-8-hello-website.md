title: Hello Website 2020!

Finally I was able to setup my own website. 

How hard can setting up a website nowadays?

This website is setup with multiple components.
  - Cloudflare for DNS
  - Cloudflare pointing to Netlify - You can view here : https://cmabastar.netlify.app
  - Github pages which you can view here : https://cmabastar.github.io/ 
  - And my own personal domain name which you can view here: https://cmabastar.dev
 
 
All of these links can be easily be updated in my github repository with jekyll as a static builder.
